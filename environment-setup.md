## What We're Installing

We need to install a few essential tools to start building React applications:

1. **WSL** (Windows only) - Linux environment for better development experience
2. **Visual Studio Code** - Your code editor (where you'll write code)
3. **Node.js with pnpm** - JavaScript runtime and package manager (lets you run JavaScript on your computer and manage code libraries)

**Time needed**: About 45-60 minutes

<summary><strong>ü™ü For Windows Users - Install WSL First (Click to expand)</strong></summary>

### Why Install WSL First?

We recommend installing WSL before VS Code because it provides a Linux environment that makes React development much smoother on Windows. VS Code will automatically detect and integrate with WSL once both are installed.

### What is WSL and Why Use It?

Setting up a development environment directly on Windows can be tricky when dealing with development tools commonly used in web development. To create a more consistent and manageable environment, we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

WSL allows you to install and run a genuine Linux distribution (like Ubuntu) directly on your Windows machine. It provides a full Unix-like command-line experience seamlessly integrated with Windows, without needing a virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

**Using WSL offers several advantages:**

- **Access to Linux Tooling**: Native access to Linux command-line tools essential for development
- **Environment Consistency**: Develop in an environment closer to typical deployment servers
- **Simplified Workflow**: Manage development tools within Linux while using Windows as your primary OS

### Installing WSL: Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Open Windows Terminal as Administrator**

WSL installation requires administrator privileges.

- **Windows 11**: Press the Windows key, type "terminal", right-click on "Windows Terminal", and select "Run as administrator"
- **Windows 10**: If you don't have Windows Terminal:
  - Open Microsoft Store, search for "Windows Terminal"
  - Install the app by Microsoft Corporation
  - Then right-click and "Run as administrator"

You'll see a User Account Control (UAC) prompt - click "Yes". The terminal opens with a PowerShell prompt.

**Step 2: Run the WSL Installation Command**

In the administrator Windows Terminal, type this command and press Enter:

```bash
wsl --install
```

This downloads and installs WSL components and the latest Ubuntu Linux distribution by default.

**Step 3: Approve UAC Prompt (if needed)**

Another UAC prompt might appear for "Windows Subsystem for Linux" installer. Click "Yes" if it appears.

**Step 4: Reboot Your Computer**

Once the command finishes, Windows requires a reboot to complete setup. Restart your computer when prompted.

**Step 5: Complete Linux Setup (After Reboot)**

After restart, an "Ubuntu" terminal window should open automatically. If not, search for "Ubuntu" in the Start menu and run it.

You'll be prompted to set up your Linux user account:

1. **Create Username**: Enter a username for your Linux environment (doesn't need to match Windows username)

2. **Set Password**:
   - Type a secure password (you won't see characters appear - this is normal Linux behavior)
   - Press Enter, then retype the same password for confirmation

**Step 6: Installation Complete**

You'll see "Installation successful!" and be at the Linux command prompt: `your_username@computer_name:~$`

**‚úÖ Congratulations!** WSL and Ubuntu are now installed and ready for development tools.

**Note**: We'll install VS Code next, which will automatically integrate with your new WSL environment.

### How to Know You're Using WSL in VS Code

Since you installed WSL first, VS Code will integrate with it automatically. Here's how to verify you're working in the WSL environment:

**Opening VS Code with WSL:**

1. Open your Ubuntu terminal (from Start menu)
2. Navigate to your project folder: `cd ~/my-projects`
3. Type: `code .` to open VS Code in that folder

**Visual Indicators in VS Code:**

- Look at the **bottom-left corner** of VS Code - you should see a green indicator that says **"WSL: Ubuntu"**
- If you see this, you're correctly using VS Code with WSL
- If you don't see it, click the green button (or empty corner) and select "Connect to WSL"

**Important**: Always work in your WSL environment for React development. Your files should be stored in the Linux filesystem (like `/home/username/projects/`) not in Windows paths (like `/mnt/c/Users/`).

## Step 3: Install Node.js

### What is Node.js?

We will heavily rely on a technology called Node.js, which you can find at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Node.js is formally defined as a "JavaScript runtime environment." While this terminology might seem a bit confusing initially, the core concept is straightforward.

The JavaScript code that runs directly within your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) operates in the browser's built-in environment. It "just works" when embedded in a webpage. However, if you want to run JavaScript code directly on your computer ‚Äì perhaps as a standalone script or to power a server ‚Äì you need a different environment capable of executing that code outside the browser context.

This is where Node.js comes in. It provides the necessary "runtime environment" to execute JavaScript files locally or on a server. Therefore, installing Node.js is a mandatory prerequisite for proceeding with React development that involves running JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

### Setting Up Node.js with NVM and pnpm

Setting up development tools might feel overwhelming at first. Don't worry if the installation process takes longer than expected ‚Äì even experienced developers sometimes spend hours troubleshooting setup issues. What matters is persistence, not speed.

We'll use VS Code's built-in terminal for the installation process, making everything happen in one place.

### Confirming Everything Works

Once the installation completes, you need to verify everything is set up correctly:

**First, refresh your terminal:**

- Close the current terminal tab (click the trash icon)
- Open a fresh terminal (Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal)
- This refresh ensures your system recognizes all the new tools

**Test Node.js installation:**
Run this command:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see a version number like `v22.x.x` (the exact number depends on the current LTS release).

**Test pnpm installation:**
Run this command:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

You should see a version number like `10.x.x`.

**Success!** If both commands show version numbers, you've successfully set up Node.js and pnpm with NVM.
